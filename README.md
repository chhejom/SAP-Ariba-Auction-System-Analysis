# SAP-Ariba-Auction-System-Analysis

## Overview
This system analysis project was completed during my internship at the United Nations, focused on improving the process of conducting English Reverse Auctions through the SAP Ariba platform.

The aim was to study and document best practices for:
- Buyers conducting auctions
- Bidders registration and participating
- System configurations within SAP Ariba to enhance usability and efficiency

The outcome is a comprehensive guideline to help UN procurement teams conduct streamlined, effective, and user-friendly auction events.

## Project Objectives
- Analyze the buyer's responsibilities in planning and launching a successful auction
- Identify optimal SAP Ariba settings for English Reverse Auctions
- Improve bidder registration and participation processes
- Map out the full auction lifecycle from setup to monitoring and closure

## Tools & Methods Used
- SAP Ariba (Test Environment)
- SAP Ariba Event Guidelines Manual
- Microsoft Presentation for documentation
- Microsoft Visio for system process diagrams

## Project Deliverables
- English_Reverse_Auction.pptx : Recommended SAP Ariba platform settings to simplify event creation, from auction launch to closure
- Bidders_Registration_in_Auction.pptx : Step-by-step preview of the supplier experience from login to bid submission
- Use_Case_Scenario.docx : Real-time auction scenario showing bidder behavior, event timing, and overtime activation
- Auction_Task.png â€“ Visual flow of key tasks required to complete the auction event, outlining responsibilities from initial setup to event closure
  
## Key Insights
- Streamlined settings in Ariba reduce buyer workload and increase auction clarity
- Clear registration instructions reduce delays in bidder onboarding
- Monitoring techniques help buyers stay responsive during live events
- Dummy Auction training for bidders before the actual event to reduce confusion and ensure timely participation
  
## Outcomes
- A process improvement guide tailored for procurement teams
- Increased transparency and efficiency in reverse auction workflows
- Practical framework for training new UN buyers or procurement staff on Ariba auctions
